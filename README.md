## Contributing to a project

1. [FastAPI](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi) is a project started by [Tiangolo](https://tiangolo.com/) AKA Sebastián Ramírez.
   [Here](https://github.com/tiangolo/blog-posts/tree/master/how-to-start-contributing-to-open-source) is his view on open-source contribution. He suggests that:

   > Newbies are great at docs, better than maintainers. Start with that.

   To some, it may sound obvious and good advice. To others, it is useless. I personally fall in the former category.

2. Github's https://opensource.guide is an all-rounder resource.
